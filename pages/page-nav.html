          <p>
            The plot of Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee! is set
            in the Kanto region and includes 151 original Pokémon and their mega
            forms from Pokémon X and Pokémon Y, as well as Pokémon Omega Ruby
            and Alpha Sapphire, and Alolan forms from Pokémon Sun and Moon. In
            Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!, some core elements of the
            main series gameplay, such as battles with non-player controlled
            trainers and gym leaders, are preserved. However, to capture wild
            Pokémon, you need to throw a Poké Ball at them (a mechanic from
            Pokémon Go) using Joy-Con controllers (by making throwing motions or
            pressing buttons and aiming if the controller is attached to the
            console) or a Poké Ball Plus.
          </p>

          <p>
            The control options allow players to use only one Joy-Con, so Let's
            Go Pikachu and Let's Go Eevee support local multiplayer on a single
            screen. Shake the second Joy-Con to join in. The second player can
            assist the first in battles (resulting in two-on-one battles against
            a single opponent's Pokémon) and catch wild Pokémon, which allows
            for two throws of a Poké Ball, increasing the chances of capturing
            them.
          </p>

          <p>
            Depending on the version, at the start of the game, the main
            character will receive either Pikachu or Eevee to sit on their
            shoulder during their journey through the Kanto region, which was
            first introduced in Pokémon Yellow. The companion will wave its tail
            when the player passes by hidden items or when the player offers
            them. Players can also dress up and groom their companion. The
            player can choose another companion Pokémon, similar to Pokémon
            HeartGold and SoulSilver, and even ride on certain large Pokémon, as
            seen in Pokémon X and Y or Pokémon Sun and Moon. Unlike previous
            games, in the new games, wild Pokémon are visible to the player (in
            previous games, they would randomly encounter the player while
            walking through tall grass or caves), and the player decides whether
            to approach them. After encountering a wild Pokémon, the battle
            screen shows the Pokémon, a button to feed it berries to make it
            easier to catch, and a Poké Ball icon (similar to Pokémon Go). The
            wild Pokémon available for capture vary in each version (e.g.,
            Oddish, Sandshrew, and Growlithe can only be captured in the Pikachu
            version, while Bellsprout, Vulpix, and Meowth can be found in the
            Eevee version).
          </p>

          <p>
            Like in all main series games, the concept of Pokémon evolution
            remains in Let's Go Pikachu and Let's Go Eevee. However, the initial
            Pikachu or Eevee obtained at the beginning of the game cannot
            evolve. If desired, players can capture additional Pokémon of the
            same species and evolve them. The breeding mechanics and hidden
            abilities have been removed.
          </p>

          <p>
            Experience points, as in all main series games starting from Pokémon
            X and Y, can be earned not only through battles but also by
            capturing wild Pokémon. In Let's Go Pikachu and Let's Go Eevee, the
            number of experience points earned depends on the accuracy and
            timing of Poké Ball throws. These games introduce a feature known as
            "candies" that can be used to enhance the stats of Pokémon (HP,
            Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed).
            Candies can be obtained by sending captured Pokémon to Professor Oak
            through the in-game storage system. The Combat Power (CP) system
            from Pokémon Go has been integrated into Pokémon Let's Go Pikachu
            and Let's Go Eevee.
          </p>

          <p>
            Players can swap their Pokémon and engage in battles when they are
            locally or globally connected. The interaction system has been
            simplified compared to previous games in the series. For example,
            the Global Trade System, Wonder Trade, and Battle Spot have been
            removed from Pokémon Let's Go Pikachu and Let's Go Eevee. To
            interact with other players over the global network, a code
            consisting of three Pokémon is generated, and both players need to
            input it on their consoles to initiate trades or battles. This
            requires a subscription to Nintendo Switch Online. Pokémon from the
            first generation and their Alolan forms from Pokémon Go can be
            transferred to the game. They will appear in the Go Park, an in-game
            location where players can encounter and capture Pokémon. Pokémon
            with a higher CP are more challenging to catch, increasing the risk
            of failure when throwing Poké Balls. Some "gifts" can be transferred
            between games. Integration with Pokémon Go is optional.
          </p>

          <p>
            On September 25, 2018, the developers announced that a mythical
            Pokémon, Meltan, a Steel-type, would be introduced in the games. On
            October 10, 2018, it was revealed that Meltan could not be captured
            without transferring a Pokémon from Pokémon Let's Go Pikachu and
            Let's Go Eevee to Pokémon Go.
          </p>

          <p>
            On October 18, 2018, the developers announced the introduction of
            Master Trainers. These non-playable characters will appear in the
            game after players have defeated all members of the Elite Four. They
            engage in one-on-one battles using specific Pokémon species, with
            the restriction of using items during battles. After defeating each
            Master Trainer, the player will be awarded the title of Master
            Trainer for the species that belonged to the defeated opponent.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Poké Ball Plus controller was specifically designed for Pokémon
            Let's Go Pikachu and Let's Go Eevee but is also compatible with
            Pokémon Go. Its use is optional. The controller has the shape of a
            Poké Ball, with the button on the top converted into an analog
            stick. The red half of the ball features a large button that does
            not protrude from the surface. The Poké Ball Plus can track
            movement, vibrate using the HD Rumble feature, emit different
            colors, and produce sounds of Pokémon. Players can press the analog
            stick to capture Pokémon instead of throwing the ball. On June 12,
            2018, during a Nintendo Direct presentation at E3 2018, it was
            revealed that the Poké Ball Plus would contain the Pokémon Mew,
            which could be transferred into the game.

            requires a subscription to Nintendo Switch Online. Pokémon from the
            first generation and their Alolan forms from Pokémon Go can be
            transferred to the game. They will appear in the Go Park, an in-game
            location where players can encounter and capture Pokémon. Pokémon
            with a higher CP are more challenging to catch, increasing the risk
            of failure when throwing Poké Balls. Some "gifts" can be transferred
            between games. Integration with Pokémon Go is optional.

            On September 25, 2018, the developers announced that a mythical
            Pokémon, Meltan, a Steel-type, would be introduced in the games. On
            October 10, 2018, it was revealed that Meltan could not be captured
            without transferring a Pokémon from Pokémon Let's Go Pikachu and
            Let's Go Eevee to Pokémon Go.
          </p>

          <p>
            On October 18, 2018, the developers announced the introduction of
            Master Trainers. These non-playable characters will appear in the
            game after players have defeated all members of the Elite Four. They
            engage in one-on-one battles using specific Pokémon species, with
            the restriction of using items during battles. After defeating each
            Master Trainer, the player will be awarded the title of Master
            Trainer for the species that belonged to the defeated opponent.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Poké Ball Plus controller was specifically designed for Pokémon
            Let's Go Pikachu and Let's Go Eevee but is also compatible with
            Pokémon Go. Its use is optional. The controller has the shape of a
            Poké Ball, with the button on the top converted into an analog
            stick. The red half of the ball features a large button that does
            not protrude from the surface. The Poké Ball Plus can track
            movement, vibrate using the HD Rumble feature, emit different
            colors, and produce sounds of Pokémon. Players can press the analog
            stick to capture Pokémon instead of throwing the ball. On June 12,
            2018, during a Nintendo Direct presentation at E3 2018, it was
            revealed that the Poké Ball Plus would contain the Pokémon Mew,
            which could be transferred into the game.
          </p>

          <p>
            The plot of Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee! is set
            in the Kanto region and includes 151 original Pokémon and their mega
            forms from Pokémon X and Pokémon Y, as well as Pokémon Omega Ruby
            and Alpha Sapphire, and Alolan forms from Pokémon Sun and Moon. In
            Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!, some core elements of the
            main series gameplay, such as battles with non-player controlled
            trainers and gym leaders, are preserved. However, to capture wild
            Pokémon, you need to throw a Poké Ball at them (a mechanic from
            Pokémon Go) using Joy-Con controllers (by making throwing motions or
            pressing buttons and aiming if the controller is attached to the
            console) or a Poké Ball Plus.
          </p>

          <p>
            The control options allow players to use only one Joy-Con, so Let's
            Go Pikachu and Let's Go Eevee support local multiplayer on a single
            screen. Shake the second Joy-Con to join in. The second player can
            assist the first in battles (resulting in two-on-one battles against
            a single opponent's Pokémon) and catch wild Pokémon, which allows
            for two throws of a Poké Ball, increasing the chances of capturing
            them.
          </p>

          <p>
            Depending on the version, at the start of the game, the main
            character will receive either Pikachu or Eevee to sit on their
            shoulder during their journey through the Kanto region, which was
            first introduced in Pokémon Yellow. The companion will wave its tail
            when the player passes by hidden items or when the player offers
            them. Players can also dress up and groom their companion. The
            player can choose another companion Pokémon, similar to Pokémon
            HeartGold and SoulSilver, and even ride on certain large Pokémon, as
            seen in Pokémon X and Y or Pokémon Sun and Moon. Unlike previous
            games, in the new games, wild Pokémon are visible to the player (in
            previous games, they would randomly encounter the player while
            walking through tall grass or caves), and the player decides whether
            to approach them. After encountering a wild Pokémon, the battle
            screen shows the Pokémon, a button to feed it berries to make it
            easier to catch, and a Poké Ball icon (similar to Pokémon Go). The
            wild Pokémon available for capture vary in each version (e.g.,
            Oddish, Sandshrew, and Growlithe can only be captured in the Pikachu
            version, while Bellsprout, Vulpix, and Meowth can be found in the
            Eevee version).

            Like in all main series games, the concept of Pokémon evolution
            remains in Let's Go Pikachu and Let's Go Eevee. However, the initial
            Pikachu or Eevee obtained at the beginning of the game cannot
            evolve. If desired, players can capture additional Pokémon of the
            same species and evolve them. The breeding mechanics and hidden
            abilities have been removed.

            Experience points, as in all main series games starting from Pokémon
            X and Y, can be earned not only through battles but also by
            capturing wild Pokémon. In Let's Go Pikachu and Let's Go Eevee, the
            number of experience points earned depends on the accuracy and
            timing of Poké Ball throws. These games introduce a feature known as
            "candies" that can be used to enhance the stats of Pokémon (HP,
            Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed).
            Candies can be obtained by sending captured Pokémon to Professor Oak
            through the in-game storage system. The Combat Power (CP) system
            from Pokémon Go has been integrated into Pokémon Let's Go Pikachu
            and Let's Go Eevee.

            Players can swap their Pokémon and engage in battles when they are
            locally or globally connected. The interaction system has been
            simplified compared to previous games in the series. For example,
            the Global Trade System, Wonder Trade, and Battle Spot have been
            removed from Pokémon Let's Go Pikachu and Let's Go Eevee. To
            interact with other players over the global network, a code
            consisting of three Pokémon is generated, and both players need to
            input it on their consoles to initiate trades or battles. This
            requires a subscription to Nintendo Switch Online. Pokémon from the

            the Global Trade System, Wonder Trade, and Battle Spot have been
            removed from Pokémon Let's Go Pikachu and Let's Go Eevee. To
            interact with other players over the global network, a code
            consisting of three Pokémon is generated, and both players need to
            input it on their consoles to initiate trades or battles. This
            requires a subscription to Nintendo Switch Online. Pokémon from the
            first generation and their Alolan forms from Pokémon Go can be
            transferred to the game. They will appear in the Go Park, an in-game
            location where players can encounter and capture Pokémon. Pokémon
            with a higher CP are more challenging to catch, increasing the risk
            of failure when throwing Poké Balls. Some "gifts" can be transferred
            between games. Integration with Pokémon Go is optional.

            On September 25, 2018, the developers announced that a mythical
            Pokémon, Meltan, a Steel-type, would be introduced in the games. On
            October 10, 2018, it was revealed that Meltan could not be captured
            without transferring a Pokémon from Pokémon Let's Go Pikachu and
            Let's Go Eevee to Pokémon Go.

            On October 18, 2018, the developers announced the introduction of
            Master Trainers. These non-playable characters will appear in the
            game after players have defeated all members of the Elite Four. They
            engage in one-on-one battles using specific Pokémon species, with
            the restriction of using items during battles. After defeating each
            Master Trainer, the player will be awarded the title of Master
            Trainer for the species that belonged to the defeated opponent.

            The Poké Ball Plus controller was specifically designed for Pokémon
            Let's Go Pikachu and Let's Go Eevee but is also compatible with
            Pokémon Go. Its use is optional. The controller has the shape of a
            Poké Ball, with the button on the top converted into an analog
            stick. The red half of the ball features a large button that does
            not protrude from the surface. The Poké Ball Plus can track
            movement, vibrate using the HD Rumble feature, emit different
            colors, and produce sounds of Pokémon. Players can press the analog
            stick to capture Pokémon instead of throwing the ball. On June 12,
            2018, during a Nintendo Direct presentation at E3 2018, it was
            revealed that the Poké Ball Plus would contain the Pokémon Mew,
            which could be transferred into the game.
